# Election_Simulation_Project
In our election simulation project, we use user-provided data for 5 provinces and 6 different political parties to create sample election results. We utilize bubble sort and multi-dimensional arrays for this purpose. The user is prompted to input party votes and the quota of parliamentary seats for each province. Using the generated simulation, we determine party vote percentages at the provincial level. The votes received by the parties are sorted in descending order, and based on this ranking, the allocation of parliamentary seats for each province is carried out.

Once the provincial results are completed, we transition to national-level data. Parties are re-ranked based on the total votes they received nationwide. In this section, we calculate not only the total vote percentages and the number of parliamentary seats won by each party but also the seat percentages. The ruling and opposition parties are determined based on these rankings.
